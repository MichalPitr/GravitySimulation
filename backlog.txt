New:
14/5/2021: Balls can overlap during collisions.

14/5/2021: Not sure if momentum calculations work for collisions between clusters.


Solved:
12/5/2021 : Must improve collisions. If two objects intersect for 2 consecutive frames
they get trapped by the way the collision works. Also collisions occur before balls touch.
Collisions also don't happen in the right directions. Resulting velocities are also wrong.
Need to use momentum and proper directions, not just reverse velocities.
