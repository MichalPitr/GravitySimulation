# GravitySimulation
This is a little project I am working on as a part of learning C++ and SFML. The idea is to have a Newtonian physics model of gravity that would allow for
simple solar system simulations. In backlog.txt I keep info about which part I am currently working on. Once I have a MVP, I'll upload a video here showcasing the program.

Current status: Gravity is seemingly working. Need to figure out how to do collisions.
